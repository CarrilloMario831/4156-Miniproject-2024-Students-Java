Bugs Documented - I would like to mention that I used the PMD PLUGIN for INTELLIJ
MOST OF THE ERRORS/BUGS I fixed via looking at the code manually.

1. getCourseLocation() in Course.java used to return the instructor name.
    Now returns the correct course location.

2. getInstructorName() in Course.java used to return the course location.
    Now returns the correct instructor name.

3. isCourseFull() method in Course.java used to incorrectly determine if the
    course was full. It now accurately determines if the course is full.

4. getNumberOfMajors() method in Department.java incorrectly returned the number of majors.
    Fixed to return the correct number of majors.

5. getDepartmentChair() in Department.java had quotes surrounding the return value.
    Removed the quotes to correctly return the return value.

6. retrieveDepartment() in RouteController.java returned HTTP NOT FOUND
    when a Department was found, and HTTP OK when a department was not found.
    It now correctly returns the correct HTTP Codes.

7. retrieveCourse() in RouteController.java returned HTTP FORBIDDEN
    when a course was found. It now returns HTTP OK.

8. In getMajorCtFromDept() in RouteController.java - Which I renamed to getMajorCountFromDept() - had a '-'
    in the responde entity, which is an error. I removed the '-' from the message.
    In addition, when the department was not found, an HTTP Forbidden code was returned. I fixed it so now it
    returns HTTP Not Found.

9. findCourseTime() in RouteController.java, did not return the course time slot, instead it had
    a string that said "some time". I fixed the string, such that it returns the course time slot.

10. handleException() in RouteController.java returned HTTP OK, when it should be an error.
    Changed to INTERNAL SERVER ERROR.

11. PMD Errorprone: Overridable method called during object construction: MyFileDatabase.deSerializeObjectFromFile()
    Made the deSerializeObjectFromFile() method to a private method since PMD suggested it.

12. PMD bestpractices: Usage of System.out/err in MyFileDatabase.java and RouteController.java
    PMD Suggested I use logging instead of system.our/err, so I switched it to logging.
